# 🔭 Goroscope
Visualize and understand your Go concurrency.

Goroscope traces goroutine lifecycles, fan-out/fan-in patterns, and blocking
behavior in real time, giving you a clear timeline of concurrency within each request.

Perfect for debugging, teaching, and understanding how Go's concurrency really works.
